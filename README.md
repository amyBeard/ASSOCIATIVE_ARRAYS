SUMMARY OF HASH ALGORITHM:
    My hashing algorithm takes the key input and goes through each character to calculate the square of the 
    assosciated ASCII value to add to the hash. I chose this hashing stategy because it creates unique complex
    numbers that minimize collisions and because it's soley based on the key input it returns the apporpriate value
    for the given key each time. Due to the unqiueness of the hash values created, it decreases the insertion cost.
